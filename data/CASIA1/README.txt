Specification of CASIA Iris Image Database(ver 1.0)
Iris recognition has been an active research topic in recent years because of its high accuracy. There is not any public iris database while there are many face and fingerprint databases. Lacking of iris data may be a block to the research of iris recognition. To promote the research, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation(IA), Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS) will provide iris database freely for iris recognition researchers.
Iris images of CASIA V1.0 were captured with a homemade iris camera. Eight 850nm NIR illuminators are circularly arranged around the sensor to make sure that iris is uniformly and adequately illuminated. In order to protect our IPR in the design of iris camera (especially the NIR illumination scheme) before appropriate patents were granted, the pupil regions of all iris images in CASIA V1.0 were automatically detected and replaced with a circular region of constant intensity to mask out the specular reflections from the NIR illuminators before public release. Clearly, such processing may affect pupil detection but has no effects on other components of an iris recognition system such as iris feature extraction since iris feature extraction only uses the image data in the region between the pupil and the sclera, i.e. the ring-shaped iris region. 
CASIA Iris Image Database(ver 1.0) includes 756 iris images from 108 eyes. For each eye, 7 images are captured in two sessions, where three samples are collected in the first session and four in the second session.
The images are stored as：
XXX \ S \ XXX_S_Y.bmp
XXX: the unique identifier of eye, range from 000 to 108.
S: the index of session.‘1’denotes the first session and‘2’the second session.
Y: the index of image in the same session. Range from 1 to 3 in the first session, 1 to 4 in the second session.
Therefore XXX_S_Y.bmp means the iris image with index Y in session S from eye XXX.
It is suggested that you compare two samples from the same eye taken in different sessions when you want to compute the within-class variability. For example, the iris images in the first session can be employed as training dataset and those from the second session are used for testing.
All rights of the CASIA database are reserved. Any person or organization is not permitted to distribute, publish, copy, or disseminate this database. For copyright protection, digital watermarking has been added into the images of this database. But the image quality and recognition result won’t be influenced by the watermarking. In all documents and papers that report experimental results based on this database, CASIA iris image database should be acknowledged as:
